## Local development

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `npm start` to start the local development server (port 4000)

## `npm` Commands

Command | Description
--- | ---
`npm run data` | Scrape and parse the source data for funding, etc. Combines `npm run scrape` and `npm run parse`.
`npm run render` | Regenerate the main content (states + people). You have to do this after every change. (By rendering locally to a static file, the browser doesn't have to do this, which is a major performance concern.)
`npm run analysis` | Regenerate analysis/statistics section. Again, after every change to that section, and for performance reasons.
`npm run css` | Regenerate basscss imports.
`npm run build` | Build the site to `dist/`.
`npm run deploy` | Build the site and deploy it to GitHub.
