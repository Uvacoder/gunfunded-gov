## `npm` Commands

Command | Description
--- | ---
`data` | Scrape and parse the source data for funding, etc. Combines `npm run scrape` and `npm run parse`.
`render` | Render static components. You have to do this after every change to the body or analysis sections (`render:analysis` and `render:body` are also available). This is very much necessary for performance.
`build` | Build the site to `docs/`.
